***"The Standardization of Accounting Language".***

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
[Abstract.]{.smallcaps} The communication of accounting information requires a special vocabulary, and, in specialized languages, standardization is a key to clear communication. We provide the first large-sample evidence on the level, determinants, and implications of accounting terminology standardization for the universe of corporate filings written in English, the lingua franca of capital markets. Three main takeaways emerge from our analyses. First, we describe the use and properties of accounting terminology and find that cognitive and dialectal causes (e.g., account-ing systems and English proficiency) are the most important drivers of terminology standardization. Second, the adoption of a new reference framework of accounting terms or tags (i.e., the introduction of IFRS and XBRL) increases standardization but conceals linguistics-related heterogeneities. Third, terminology standardization is negatively associated with both the incompleteness within and differences across accounting databases, consistent with the idea of standardized language being instrumental for users in extracting accounting information and reducing information processing costs.
