***"The Standardization of Accounting Language".***

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
[Abstract.]{.smallcaps} The communication of accounting information requires a special vocabulary (i.e., terminology) and in specialized languages, standardization is considered key to effective and unambiguous communication. We provide the first large sample-based evidence on the level, determinants, and implications of accounting terminology standardization by examining a global sample of more than 330,000 annual reports from 1995 to 2019. Three main takeaways emerge from our analyses. First, cognitive and dialectal causes (e.g., accounting systems and English proficiency) are the most important drivers of terminology standardization. Second, the adoption of a new reference framework of accounting terms or tags (i.e., the introduction of IFRS worldwide and XBRL in the United States) increases standardization but also conceals important linguistics-related heterogeneities. Third, terminology standardization is negatively associated with both the incompleteness within and differences across accounting databases, consistent with the idea of standardized language being instrumental for users in extracting accounting information and reducing information processing costs.
